I'm currently working on a real2sim pipeline with others, using [GaussGym](https://escontrela.me/gauss_gym/) and [LangSplatv2](https://langsplat-v2.github.io/). For a recent project, check out my work converting [3d gaussian splat captures into segmented scene graph](https://github.com/lukehollis/SplatGraph/) with predictive physics properties for each object. 

For other recent experiments, try out [text-to-3d-simulation on a map](https://struct.inc/map/) against real-time LiveUA Map data and my migration of Unity's [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to [Three.js+Python](https://github.com/lukehollis/three-mlagents). 

See my website for more information and recent work [lukehollis.com](https://www.lukehollis.com/)
