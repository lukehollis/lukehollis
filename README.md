Hey, I'm an applied RL / 3d engineer working on simulations. I'm currently a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab cs sf lab. I code, teach, and create 3d captures.

For a recent project, try out [text-to-3d-simulation on a map](https://struct.inc/map/) to generate anything in our past or potential futures.
