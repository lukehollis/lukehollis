Hey, I'm an applied RL / 3d engineer working on simulations. I'm currently a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab cs sf lab and getting a Masters in Data Science at Harvard '27 exp.

For a recent project, try out [text-to-3d-simulation on a map](https://struct.inc/map/) against real-time LiveUA Map data.

I also migrated Unity's [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to [Three.js+Python](https://github.com/lukehollis/three-mlagents). These run PPO mostly using SB3 and train other various RL and SSL models in Python and Torch and then use Three.js as a visualization layer.
