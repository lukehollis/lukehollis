I'm Luke, I work on autonomous systems and simulators. For a recent project, check out my work converting 3d gaussian splat captures into segmented scene graph with predictive physics properties for each object.

Also try out [text-to-3d-simulation on a map](https://struct.inc/map/) against real-time LiveUA Map data.

I migrated Unity's [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to [Three.js+Python](https://github.com/lukehollis/three-mlagents). These run PPO mostly using SB3 and train other various RL and SSL models in Python and Torch and then use Three.js as a visualization layer.
